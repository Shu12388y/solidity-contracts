## Solidity Program

- Solidity version
    The version statement at the top of a solidity contract specifies the
    version of the solidity compiler that should be used to compile the
    contract.


- Variable
    In Solidity, variables are used to store data within a contract. They can hold different type of values and are fundamental to writing smart 
    contracts.

Primitive 

1. Unsigned Numbers
    - uint8 - small number
    - uint16 - 16 bit number
    - uint256 - 256 bit number

2. Signed Numbers
    - int
    - int32

3. Boolean

4. Address

5. String



6. Constructor
    A constructor is solidity is a special function that is executed only once during the deployment of the contract. It's primary purpose is to
    initialze the contract's state variable and set up any required logic
    when the contract is deployed to the ethereum blockchain.
