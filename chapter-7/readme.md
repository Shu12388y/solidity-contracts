## Arrays

```
    There are two types of arrays in solidity
        - Fixed-size arrays: Arrays where the size is defined when the array
        is created, and it cannot be changed afterward.
        - Dynamic arrays: Where the size can change dynamically during execution(i.e. you can add or remove elements)


```
