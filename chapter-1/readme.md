## Solidity
Solidity is a high level, statically-typed programming language used to 
write smart contracts for etherum and other blockchain platforms that are
compatiable with the etherum virtual machine (EVM). These smart contract
are self executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.

## ByteCode
Bytecode is the low level code that is generated after a smart contract
written in a high level language like solidity is compiled. It is a
understood and executed by the etherum virual machine.

This bytecode is what gets deployed to the etherum blockchain when you 
publish a smart contract.

## ABIs
In Etherum, an ABi(Application Binary Interface) is a standardized  way for 
interacting with smart contract. It defines how data should be encoded and 
decoded when being sent to and from a contract on the etherum blockchain.
